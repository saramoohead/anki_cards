About 400 flashcards covering Ruby, Terminal, Github, and Ruby logic, with a bit of RSpec created with and designed to be used by the memory "spaced recognition system" Anki: available for free at www.ankisrs.net.

If I make significant additions, I will update the decks.

Disclaimer: There may be some cards where I am cajoling myself - please don't take offense! Also, I might not have things exactly right. If you spot errors, please let me know.
